# Mixt examples

Here are some examples to see how to use `Mixt`.

To see the output of an example, run:

```bash
python -m mixt.examples.example-name
```

So far we have three examples:

- `simple`: a simple component, written in `mixt` (html-in-python)
- `simple_pure_python`: the same component but written in pure python
- `user_guide`: components, context, higher-order components... final version of the code presented in the user-guide (available in `mixt` and `pure python` version)
